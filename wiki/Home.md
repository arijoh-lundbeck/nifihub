## What's in This Repo

**Extension Bundles** (`extensions/`) — Reusable NiFi processors, controller services, and reporting tasks packaged as NARs. Each bundle has its own version and release lifecycle and is published to GitHub Releases as a downloadable NAR.

**Flow Definitions** (`flows/`) — Versioned NiFi flow definitions exported as JSON, with companion documentation and automated validation tests. Flows can be imported directly into NiFi or deployed to a Snowflake Openflow runtime.

**Environments** (`environments/`) — GitOps configuration for managing Openflow deployments, runtimes, and flow assignments declaratively. Changes to `config.yaml` files are automatically applied to Snowflake via GitHub Actions.
