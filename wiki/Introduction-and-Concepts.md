## Key Concepts

### Apache NiFi

[Apache NiFi](https://nifi.apache.org/) is a data flow automation platform. Flows are built from **processors** (data transformation units) connected by **relationships**, grouped into **process groups**. Flows can be exported as JSON definitions and imported into any NiFi instance.

### Extension Bundles (NARs)

NiFi extensions are packaged as **NARs** (NiFi Archive files) — the NiFi equivalent of a JAR with an isolated classloader. A NAR bundles one or more processors, controller services, or reporting tasks along with their dependencies. NiFi Hub publishes NARs to GitHub Releases; you download and drop them into NiFi's NAR directory.

### Flow Definitions

Flow definitions are JSON files exported from NiFi's UI. They capture the complete structure of a process group: processors, connections, controller services, parameters, and their configuration. NiFi Hub stores flows as versioned JSON alongside documentation and validation tests.

### Flow Registry and Versioning

NiFi has a built-in **Flow Registry** concept that lets flows be versioned in an external store. NiFi Hub uses a **Git-based registry client** so that the `flows/` directory acts as the registry — each flow version maps to a Git commit or tag. See [GitHub Registry Client](Introduction-and-Concepts--GitHub-Registry-Client).
